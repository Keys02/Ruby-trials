# 🧪 Developer Skill Assessment – Ruby Contact Book Project

## 🧩 Overall Level: **Early Intermediate Developer (in Ruby)**

You’re no longer a beginner, but not yet advanced — and that’s a *great* place to be. You’ve demonstrated foundational strength and structural thinking, with clear opportunities for growth in Ruby-specific practices.

---

## ✅ What You’ve Demonstrated So Far

### 🧠 Fundamental Understanding
- Correct use of functions and method definitions.
- File I/O with correct modes (`"r"` for reading, `"a"` for appending).
- Usage of string interpolation, user input, and control flow (`if` statements).

### 🧱 Structural Thinking
- Good separation of concerns (input, logic, display).
- Clean flow with a dedicated `run` method as the entry point.
- Organized and readable code.

### 💡 CLI Awareness
- Focused on usability with prompts and output formatting.
- Understands how users interact with a script.

## ⚠️ Areas That Feel Beginner-Level

### 🔒 File Handling Idioms
- Missing file closing (`.close`) or Ruby-style block usage (`File.open do |f| ... end`).

### 🛑 Error Handling
- No handling for file-not-found, invalid input, etc.
- No user feedback for invalid menu options.

### 🧼 Input Validation
- Phone number format or empty name checks are not present.

### 📦 Ruby Idioms & Features
- No usage of symbols, blocks, or classes yet.
- Not leveraging built-in Ruby utilities to simplify logic.

## 🎯 Summary Table

| Category           | Rating       |
|--------------------|--------------|
| Core Syntax        | ✅ Solid      |
| File I/O           | ✅ Functional |
| Structure          | ✅ Clear      |
| Idiomatic Ruby     | ⚠️ Needs Work |
| Error Handling     | ❌ Missing    |
| Input Validation   | ⚠️ Minimal    |

## 🏁 Final Thoughts

You're in a **strong position to grow**:
- You’ve built something that works — and is structured logically.
- The next step is to start thinking **defensively** (what could go wrong?) and **idiomatically** (how Ruby likes things to be written).

Keep learning, build more mini-projects, and start exploring:
- Classes and objects
- Exception handling (`begin...rescue`)
- Using Ruby blocks and `File.open { |f| ... }` pattern
- Small gem libraries (e.g., `tty-prompt`, `json`)

Great job so far! 💪
